# S/W Development Completion Report

## 1. Project Result

### 1.1 Development Period and Responsibilities
**Development timeframe:** September – December 2025  
**Project type:** New Development Project  

**Team roles and responsibilities:**
*   **Rustam Zaloldinov:** Lead Developer and Architect. Responsible for the implementation of the core logic, repository pattern, and file persistence mechanisms.
*   **Ekaterina Lugovets:** Technical Writer and QA. Responsible for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), Detailed Level Design (DLD) documentation, UML diagrams, and validation testing.

**Short description of each member’s contribution:**
Rustam focused on the C++ implementation, ensuring clean separation of concerns and robust memory management. Ekaterina defined the domain rules, created the architectural diagrams, and ensured that all edge cases were covered by the validation logic.

### 1.2 Project Achievements
*   **Release 1:** Established the project scope and created the SRS. Defined the initial domain models for `User` and `Listing` and implemented basic console operations.
*   **Release 2:** Refactored the system into a layered architecture (UI, Domain, Repository). Created UML diagrams including activity and sequence diagrams for core operations, as documented in `DLD.md`.
*   **Release 3:** Implemented comprehensive validation rules for all input fields (age, price, non-empty strings) and a structured exception handling system using custom domain exceptions (`ValidationException`, `DuplicateEntryException`, `NotFoundException`).
*   **Release 4:** Introduced persistent storage via `FileUserRepository`. Implemented file loading and saving logic for `data.txt`, managed the memory lifecycle of domain objects within vectors, and added helper functions for case-insensitive duplicate detection.

### 1.3 Development Effect and Utilization
**Summary of the final architecture:**
The system follows a clean layered architecture where the UI (`AdminPanel`) depends only on an interface (`IUserRepository`). This allows for easy swapping of storage implementations (In-memory vs. File-based) without modifying the presentation layer.

**Technical capabilities:**
The application supports full CRUD operations for users and their associated listings, with real-time validation and persistent storage.

**Skills gained:**
The team gained deep knowledge in C++ object-oriented design, the repository pattern, exception-safe code, and file I/O operations.

**Possibilities for reuse or extension:**
The repository interface can be extended to support database storage (e.g., SQLite). The validation logic is modular and can be reused in a web-based or GUI version of the Admin Panel.

## 2. Development History

### 2.1 Development S/W Structure
**Description of layers:**
*   **UI Layer:** `AdminPanel` class handles user input, menu display, and exception catching to show user-friendly errors.
*   **Logic Layer:** `User` and `Listing` models represent the domain entities and their relationships.
*   **Repository Layer:** `IUserRepository` interface defines the data contract, while `FileUserRepository` handles the actual storage logic and domain validation.

**Data flow between layers:**
1. UI collects data from the user.
2. UI calls the Repository methods.
3. Repository validates data and performs logic (duplicate checks).
4. Repository persists data to `data.txt` and returns results.
5. UI displays success or catches exceptions to show errors.

**Main project files:**
*   `main.cpp`: Entry point.
*   `AdminPanel.{h,cpp}`: UI management.
*   `User.{h,cpp}`, `Listing.{h,cpp}`: Domain models.
*   `FileUserRepository.{h,cpp}`: File-based persistence.
*   `DomainExceptions.h`: Custom exception types.

**Structural changes in Release 4:**
The addition of `FileUserRepository` required implementing serialization and deserialization logic. The `AdminPanel` was updated to instantiate the file-based repository instead of the in-memory one, demonstrating the flexibility of the interface-based design.

### 2.2 Development Deliverables
*   **SRS (Release 1):** Documented in the initial project phase (reflected in README and DLD scope).
*   **DLD versions (Releases 2, 3, 4):** Comprehensive `docs/DLD.md` containing validation tables and exception mappings.
*   **UML diagrams:** Activity and Sequence diagrams for the "Create User" flow included in `DLD.md`.
*   **Source code files:** All `.h` and `.cpp` files in the `src/` directory.
*   **data.txt example file:** The persistence file generated by the application to store user data.

### 2.3 Development Environment
*   **Operating system:** Windows 11 / macOS (Cross-platform support).
*   **Compiler or IDE:** CLion (JetBrains) with CMake build system and C++20 compiler.
*   **Version control system:** Git was used for tracking changes across releases.
